# Disclaimer

Whether I try a novel approach, a new programming language, handle edge cases or just brute force the result as fast and simply as possible depends on the day. There is no guarantee of quality or efficiency here.

# Usage

## `ts/*`

For TypeScript solutions, generally you can run `$ npx ts-node lib/day-XX/exec.ts` from the project root to get results for both parts of each day.
